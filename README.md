# 404-page
create a webpage with the dreaded 404 error message, to which users can be redirected if the resource they requested doesn't exist.
Error 404: Page not found

Project brief included in the folder.  â€” This document shows you what the page is supposed to look like and contains detailed instructions on how to code it.
When you look at the brief, you'll see that the webpage has two states:
A webpage with an image and the number "404"
The same webpage, but with some additional text explaining what the 404 error means
My goal is to implement both of these states using HTML and CSS. In the second state, the additional text appears when the mouse is hovering over the 404. I can implement this feature using CSS.
